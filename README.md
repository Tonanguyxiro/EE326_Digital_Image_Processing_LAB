# EE326:Digital Image Processing LAB

## At the begining
This project is the lab exercise of cource **EE326 Digital Image Processing** in **Southern University of Science and Technology**

## LAB 1:Numpy and matplotlib

In this course we will learn to install anaconda and use numpy as well as matplotlib which you cannot use in the following labs.

## LAB 2:Image Interpolation

In this course we will try to use different algorithms of **Image Interpolation** to resize the image.

1. Use nearest neighbor interpolation and bilinear interpolation to interpolate a grey scale image.
2. Use Python function “interp2” from packet “scipy” or your own written algorithm to interpolate a grey scale image by using bicubic interpolation.
